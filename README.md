This repository contains the code for the paper MorpheuS: Neural Dynamic 360째 Surface Reconstruction from Monocular RGB-D Video, a dynamic surface reconstruction method that leverages a diffusion prior to achieve 360째 surface reconstruction.



## Update

- [x] Code for visualization of the results [2024-3-25]
- [x] Code for data pre-processing [2024-3-21]
- [x] Code for MorpheuS [2024-3-18]

## Installation

For detailed instructions, please refer to [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).

## Dataset

Please download here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mDuIauf-jxVvvAuefWTt8zK2mUKp_UFr?usp=sharing). Alternatively, use our download script:

```sh
bash scripts/download_data.sh
```

To create your own dataset, please refer to [preprocess](./preprocess/).

## Run

You can run MorpheuS using the code below:

```sh
python morpheus.py --config './configs/snoopy.yaml'
```

For visualizing the results, you can use:

```sh
python visualizer.py --config './configs/snoopy.yaml'
```

## Advanced tips

I have included my tips in the comments prefixed with "NOTE". Given the extensive complexity of this project and the numerous experiments conducted, reading these tips is strongly encouraged to gain a deeper understanding.

Please be aware that this project has undergone significant refactoring. As a result, certain sections may differ from the original codebase. However, these modifications are intended to enhance overall performance and results. If anything is broken, don't hesitate to open an issue:)
